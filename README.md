Description Below:
Dynamic consolidation of Virtual Machines (VMs)
can effectively enhance the resource utilization and energyefficiency
of the Cloud Data Centers (CDC). Existing research on
Cloud resource reservation and scheduling signify that Cloud
Service Users (CSUs) can play a crucial role in improving the
resource utilization by providing valuable information to Cloud
service providers. However, utilization of CSUs’ provided
information in minimization of energy consumption of CDC is a
novel research direction. The challenges herein are twofold.
First, finding the right benign information to be received from a
CSU which can complement the energy-efficiency of CDC.
Second, smart application of such information to significantly
reduce the energy consumption of CDC. To address those
research challenges, we have proposed a novel heuristic Dynamic
VM Consolidation algorithm, RTDVMC, which minimizes the
energy consumption of CDC through exploiting CSU provided
information. Our research exemplifies the fact that if VMs are
dynamically consolidated based on the time when a VM can be
removed from CDC – a useful information to be received from
respective CSU, then more physical machines can be turned into
sleep state, yielding lower energy consumption. We have
simulated the performance of RTDVMC with real Cloud
workload traces originated from more than 800 PlanetLab VMs.
The empirical figures affirm the superiority of RTDVMC over
existing prominent Static and Adaptive Threshold based DVMC
algorithms
